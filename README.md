# animal-models-mice
Custom scripts used in generating results of the animal model (mice) studies
In this work we analysed phenotypic traits from genetic mouse models, covering distinct phenotypes. The research covers:
1.	A systematic cross-analysis of phenotypes from various mouse models, revealing shared characteristics across different diseases.
2.	Identification of the phenotypes with the highest translational potential that can be used in future human clinical trials.
3.	Insights into novel disease adjacencies that suggest potential new targets for drug development.
4.	The use of NLP techniques to align mouse phenotypes with human clinical features and established trial endpoints.



The scripts are designed by Ms. Nathalie Lefebvre and are uploaded to this Github for scientific communications.
